This FPGA project aim is to organize the process but in more modern way than the
conventional way. It uses the seven-segment display to guide the user step by step, it as
well counts the used machines. That is helpful in the dorms that uses high number of
washing machine.
I worked in this project before with my colleagues. This course would be a great opportunity
to carry on the process of the project.
