This project can be further developed by making a central system where lot of machines
serves lot of people. Also employing the an app for wireless connection with smartphones
or tablets using IoT will help people find out if there is an available machine or not. A
booking system also would be helpful when the system in full state instead of waiting for
turn, a booking can be done through this app.
