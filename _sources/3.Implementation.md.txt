# Implementation

## Block design
Below is the block diagram of the project, a better overview can be found in the project
repository [here](https://mygit.th-deg.de/hj03417/fpga_project/-/raw/main/Images/Block%20diagram.jpg)

## Memory block
The user can input here the address of the machine and its output if the machine is available
or not.

## Payment Block
in this block we have lot of state machines between the payments statues from 0 up to 290
cent. It has 2 outputs, if 2 euro is paid then high is asserted, if not low will be asserted.

## Laundry system core
Here all the input of the system is being evaluated and based on the output will be asserted
to the seven segment display. Here we have the 6 state machines. The flow will be explained
later in the report.

## Segment display
2 Seven-segment displays are being used one as counter of the machines and the other
one is the guidance.

## Test bench and Hardware design
I tried different inputs for the system but I had always the same output which means that
is something wrong in the code which I unfortunately was not able to find the error
exactly. I built another simpler code ( will be attached as well) and the problem has not
been solved. [system testbench](https://mygit.th-deg.de/hj03417/fpga_project/-/raw/main/Images/Test_bench.jpg).

I believe that my mistake was building the Seven-segment_displays without consideration of the architecture of the
Boolean board.
I dealt with the board as it has different 4 different displays while they can be decoded with activation o0f anode and cathode.
