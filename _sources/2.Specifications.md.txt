# Specifications

the automated laundry system functions as follows.
There are 9 machines in the room, there is several inputs like the nearby person sensor,
that will give 1 once there are a person near the machine like the sensor that is being used
in ATMs. And there are also outputs like the change of the coin and the results of course
are displayed on the seven-segment display. A memory is used to show the how many
washing machines are available. For easiness of programming the user can insert 50 cent
and one euro, The needed amount is 200 cents for activation a machine.
For example, when a person is nearby the sensor detects the user and activate the system.
A memory is being used to count the used machines to detect the availability state, the
user also has to input a pin that is for the system.
If there are available machine it will be used to process to the next stage which is
payment. The seven-segment display will show PAY, Full and many other situations. If the
coins are being inserted the stage 4 then will be activated.
The summation of the inserted coins is shown on the seven-segment display. If the
summation reaches 200 cent the next step will be then activated which is the start state if
the coins are more than 200 an output of the change will be then triggered

As explained above we will be having 6 machine states

no_action_state : initial state

user_detect_state
This state detects if a user near the controller via sensor.

verification_state
This state comes after user detected state where the user has been detected and the user
will need to enter a password. Then verify the password will be handled here and if the
password is correct the used washing machine number will be displayed on the 7-
segement-display.

availability_state
A memory check will be proceeded here to check if the entered washing machine number
to be used is available or not.

payment_state
Now the user can pay for the wash using 50, 20, 10 and 5 cents.

start_state
The user ready to use the washing machine.

full_state
Will display full sign on the 7-segment-display screen

<p align="center"> Fig.2.2 Boolean board inputs and outputs that are used in the project </p>  
 



In this project there are 1 major hardware components which are:
• FPGA board: Xilinx Spartan-7 XC7S50 CSGA324
https://www.realdigital.org/hardware/boolean



In the Image above the inputs and the output representation is
Input
- Nearby person sensor (Switch) → nearby person is approaching the system
- Push button [0:3]→ to trigger the payment elements which is 50 and 100 cents
- 4 switches for the address
- 4 switches for the password
- Clock → Main clock of the Boolean board(100MHz)
Output
- Seven segment display1 → will display the number of available machines
- Seven segment display2 → will guide the user
- Led (0-3)→ Green LED for Coin_out
