# Literature research

The idea for this project came from my previous work experience as Technical Trainer, I had
installed this device in the office building which was used to communicate between the service 
office and other offices, for example, if number one shows on the display that means 
the manager is calling. Based on that, each number indicates a specific call for help as
shown below â†“.

- Number one   &rarr; Manager Office   
- Number two   &rarr; Manager Assistant Office
- Number three &rarr; Chief Executive Office
- Number four  &rarr; Chief Operating Office 
- Number five  &rarr; Chief Financial Office 
- Number six   &rarr; Chief Information Office 
- Number seven &rarr; Chief Technology Office 
- Number eight &rarr; Chief Human Resources Office 
- Number nine  &rarr; Chief Data Office
